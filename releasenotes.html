                <li>Create profile pages for creating handler and dog profiles : 
                    The handler profile is based on the user sign-on info and is a once off creation.
                    The dog profile can be created per dog for the current handler/user signed in.

                <li>Created a profile summary screen where the handler and all linked dogs are listed and are
